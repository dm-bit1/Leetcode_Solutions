The solution file solves Leetcode 2553. Separate the Digits in an Array and beats 92% of runtimes.
Given an array of positive integers nums, return an array answer that consists of the digits of
each integer in nums after separating them in the same order they appear in nums.

The intuition involves using modulo and integer division to get each digit in an integer and a math function to get the number of digits.

Time complexity is O(nm) for n numbers in the array, m digits in each number.
