The solution solves Leetcode 2367 Number of Arithmetic Triplets. The runtime is 3ms, beats 87% on average.
Intuition? Check for the right difference where j is one index in front of i and k starts from j for the loop variables.
Time Complexity? O(n^3) for n elements in the array
Space Complexity? O(1) as no additional space for the container, only variables.
