The solution solves Leetcode 2697 Lexicographically smallest palindrome. Runs in 33ms on average, beats 75%.
Time Complexity? O(n) for n elements in the string.
Space? O(n) for n elements in the string parameter.
Intuition? Iterate from the start and end in two variables and converge at the midpoint, swapping elements that do not match.
