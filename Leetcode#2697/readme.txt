The solution solves Leetcode 2697 Lexicographically smallest palindrome. Runs in 30ms on average, beats 85%.
Time Complexity? O(n) for n elements in the string.
Space? O(n) for n elements in the string parameter.
Intuition? Iterate from the start and end in two variables and converge at the midpoint, swapping elements that do not match with the least expensive character.
