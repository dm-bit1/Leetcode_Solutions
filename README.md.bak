This repository contains some solutions to Leetcode problems. The motivation behind is that it was brought to my attention that solving tricky Leetcode problems is supposed to improve coding ability. So, I solved some problems withouting looking at any solutions or AI and pushed them to this repository. There was a few times I checked a solution and it involved some tricky bitwise operation but most of the time I did not check solutions or AI.
