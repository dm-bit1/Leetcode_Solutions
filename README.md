This repository contains some solutions to Leetcode problems. 
The motivation behind is that it was brought to my attention that solving tricky Leetcode problems is supposed to improve coding ability. 
There was a few times I checked a solution and it involved some tricky bitwise operation or something similar. 
Most of the time I did not check solutions or AI.
